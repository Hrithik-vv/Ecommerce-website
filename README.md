## Starting the Application

The application now includes intelligent port management that automatically handles cases where the port is already in use.

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the application with nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes.

### Production Mode

```bash
npm start
```

This starts the application in production mode.

### Debug Mode

```bash
npm run debug
```

This starts the application with Node's inspector for debugging.

## Automatic Port Management

The application now automatically:

1. Checks if the specified port is already in use
2. Identifies the process using the port
3. Attempts to kill the conflicting process
4. Starts the server on the cleared port

This eliminates the need to manually find and kill processes when you encounter the "port already in use" error.

## Referral System

The platform includes a referral system where:

1. Users can share their unique referral code with friends
2. When a new user signs up using a referral code, the referrer receives â‚¹50 in their wallet
3. Users can track their referrals and earnings in their profile

## Wallet System

Users have a digital wallet that:

1. Stores credits earned from referrals
2. Can be used for making purchases
3. Allows viewing transaction history
